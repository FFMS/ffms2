<h2>Limitations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Requires <a href='http://haali.cs.msu.ru/mkv/'>Haali's Media Splitter</a> if ogm or mpeg ps/ts is to be opened.</li>
<li>Haali's splitter requires transport streams to be cut at packet boundaries. Use <a href='http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=125447'>TsRemux</a> to fix the stream before trying to open it.</li>
<li>Because of LAVF's demuxer most raw streams will fail to work properly such as elementary h264 and other mpeg video streams.</li>
<li>FFAudioSource() will have to remake any index implicitly created by FFVideoSource() and therefore code like
<pre>
AudioDub(FFVideoSource(X), FFAudioSource(X))
</pre>
will require two indexing passes. Apart from the time consumed this is harmless. To work around it open the audio first
<pre>
A = FFAudioSource(X)
V = FFVideoSource(X)
AudioDub(V, A)
</pre>
or use FFIndex().
<pre>
FFIndex(X)
AudioDub(FFVideoSource(X), FFAudioSource(X))
</pre>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Known issues</h2>
<ul>
<li>There will appear decoding artifacts on h264 in transport streams.</li>
<li>FFIndex() will silently ignore fatal decoding errors when indexing. This means that indexing a specific track may have failed even if FFIndex() succeeds.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Compatibility</h2>
<ul>
<li>AVI, MKV, MP4, FLV: Frame accurate</li>
<li>WMV: Frame accurate(?) but avformat seems to pick keyframes relatively far away</li>
<li>OGM: Frame accurate(?)</li>
<li>VOB, MPG: Seeking seems to be off by one or two frames now and then</li>
<li>M2TS, TS: Seeking seems to be off a few frames here and there</li>
<li>Image files: Most formats can be opened if seekmode=-1 is set, no animation support</li>
</ul>

<h2>Functions in FFMS2.dll</h2>
<p>
<b>FFIndex(string source, string cachefile = source + ".ffindex", int indexmask = -1, int dumpmask = 0, string audiofile = "%sourcefile%.%trackzn%.w64", int errorhandling = 3, bool overwrite = false, bool utf8 = false)</b><br />
 Used to invoke indexing separately with a few additional options and to write audio tracks to disk as wave64 files. It can be useful to use to avoid remaking the index twice or if some audio tracks are unsupported/broken and cannot be indexed properly.
</p>

<p>
<b>FFVideoSource(string source, int track, bool cache = true, string cachefile = source + ".ffindex", int fpsnum = -1, int fpsden = 1, string pp, int threads = -1, string timecodes, int seekmode = 1, int rffmode = 0, int width = -1, int height = -1, string resizer = "BICUBIC", string colorspace = "", bool utf8 = false)</b><br />
 Opens video, will invoke indexing of all video tracks if no usable index is found.
</p>

<p>
<b>FFAudioSource(string source, int track, bool cache = true, string cachefile = source + ".ffindex", int adjustdelay = -1, bool utf8 = false)</b><br />
 Opens audio, will invoke indexing of all tracks if no index exists or the requested track is not present in the index.
</p>

<p>
<b>FFPP(clip, string pp)</b><br />
  Separate postprocessing which also seems to include a few simple deinterlacers. Use the pp argument in FFVideoSource whenever possible as it will also have access to the video quantizers and thus adapt better to the video.
</p>

<p>
<b>SWScale(clip, int width = -1, int height = -1, string resizer = "BICUBIC", string colorspace = "")</b><br />
  A resizing/colorspace conversion filter that does nothing special at all. May be useful in some cases just because it does not do things exactly like avisynth.
</p>

<p>
<b>FFSetLogLevel(int Level = -8)</b><br />
  Sets the log FFmpeg logging level. Defaults to quiet (-8) and the FFmpeg default is 16. All possible different values can be found in avutil/log.h.
</p>

<p>
<b>FFGetLogLevel()</b><br />
  Returns the current level of logging as an int.
</p>

<h2>Functions in FFMS2.avsi</h2>
<p>
<b>FFmpegSource2(string source, int vtrack = -1, int atrack = -2, bool cache = true,
 string cachefile = source + ".ffindex", int fpsnum = -1, int fpsden = 1, string pp, int threads = -1,
	string timecodes, int seekmode = 1, bool overwrite = false, int width = -1, int height = -1, string resizer = "BICUBIC", string colorspace = "", int rffmode = 0,
	int adjustdelay = -1)</b><br />
 Approximates the syntax later versions of the 1.x series. Can be convenient to use with atrack=-1 to load both audio and video at the same time. Note that the adjustdelay parameter may need to be specified for the expected behavior if a video track other than the first is selected.
</p>

<p>
<b>FFImageSource(string source, int width = -1, int height = -1, string resizer = "BICUBIC", string colorspace = "")</b><br />
 Another alias for FFVideoSource with the options set optimally for using it as an image reader. Disables caching and seeking for maximum compatiblity.
</p>

<p>
<b>FFFormatTime(int ms)</b><br />
 A helper function to format time given in milliseconds into a h:mm:ss.ttt string.
</p>

<p>
<b>FFInfo(clip c, bool framenum = true, bool frametype = true, bool cfrtime = true, bool vfrtime = true)</b><br />
 A helper function to show general information about the current frame. Note that not all values are exported in all source modes and will therefore not always be shown.
</p>

<h2>Function arguments</h2>
<p>
<b>source:</b>
  Source file.
</p>

<p>
<b>indexmask &amp; dumpmask:</b>
  Which audio tracks to index/write to disk. Dumping a track also implies indexing since the same work has to be done anyway. It is a binary mask meaning that 7 corresponds to writing tracks 1-3. Non-audio tracks are ignored. -1 writes all tracks.
</p>

<p>
<b>audiofile:</b>
  The filename to use for dumped audio tracks. Make sure to include a track number variable to avoid multiple file access errors. The variables are case sensitive. The available variables are:<br />
<b>%sourcefile%</b> - same as the source argument, the file the audio is decoded from<br />
<b>%trackn%</b> - the track number<br />
<b>%trackzn%</b> - the track number zero padded to 2 digits<br />
<b>%samplerate%</b> - self explanatory<br />
<b>%channels%</b> - self explanatory<br />
<b>%bps%</b> - bits per sample<br />
<b>%delay%</b> - delay, or more exactly the first timestamp encountered in the audio stream
</p>

<p>
<b>overwrite:</b>
  Forces reindexing even if a valid index already exists. May be useful for trackmask changes or testing.
</p>

<p>
<b>track:</b>
  Track number as seen by the relevant demuxer. Starts from 0, -1 means it will pick the first suitable track. This may however NOT be the first video/audio track found if it is not indexed but a later one is.
</p>

<p>
<b>fpsnum &amp; fpsden:</b>
  For VFR -&gt; CFR conversion. Setting fpsnum &lt;= 0 means a 1:1 relation with the encoded frames.
</p>

<p>
<b>timecodes:</b>
  File to output timecodes to. If the file exists it will be overwritten.
</p>

<p>
<b>cache:</b>
  Write indexing information to a file for later use. This setting controls both loading of existing indices and the writing of new ones.
</p>

<p>
<b>cachefile</b>
  Where to write the cache information.
</p>

<p>
<b>pp:</b>
  See the table below for a full description, an empty string means no processing. It is recommended to avoid the autoq option since it's currently unknown what effect it will have on the processing.
</p>

<p>
<b>threads:</b>
  Sets the number of decoder threads used. Defaults to the number of logical cpus reported by windows. Ignored by lavc if the used decoder doesn't implement it.
</p>

<p>
<b>seekmode:</b>
  Control how seeking is handled, has no effect on matroska or haali splitter opened files which always use the equivalent of seekmode=1.<br />
    <b>-1:</b> linear access without rewind, will throw an error if each successive requested frame number isn't bigger than the last one, only intended for opening images but might work on well with some obscure video format<br />
    <b>0:</b> linear access, the definition of slow but should make some formats "usable"<br />
    <b>1:</b> safe normal, bases seeking decisions on the reported keyframe positions<br />
    <b>2:</b> unsafe normal, same as 1 but no error will be thrown if the exact destination has to be guessed<br />
    <b>3:</b> aggressive, seek in the forward direction even if no closer keyframe is known to exist, only useful for testing and containers where avformat doesn't report keyframes properly
</p>

<p>
<b>rffmode:</b>
  Controls how RFF flags in the video stream is treated.<br />
    <b>0:</b> Ignore all flags<br />
    <b>1:</b> Honor all pulldown flags<br />
    <b>2:</b> Equivalent to force film<br />
  Note that setting rffmode &gt; 0 will throw an error if the video stream has no RFF flags at all. When engaged it will also make the output be assumed as CFR, disallow vertical scaling and setting the output colorspace. FFPICT_TYPE will also not be set as the output is a combination of several frames. Other subtle behavior changes may also exist.
</p>

<p>
<b>width &amp; height:</b>
  Width and height to resize to. Value below or equal to 0 is the same as specifying the input dimensions.
</p>

<p>
<b>resizer:</b>
  Selects the resizer used for resampling the chroma planes and normal resizing. The available methods are: FAST_BILINEAR, BILINEAR, BICUBIC, X, POINT, AREA, BICUBLIN, GAUSS, SINC, LANCZOS and SPLINE.
</p>

<p>
<b>colorspace:</b>
  The colorspace to convert to. The names are YV12, YUY2, RGB24, RGB32 and the empty string for same as input.
</p>

<p>
<b>errorhandling:</b>
  Controls what happens when an audio decoding error is encountered.<br />
    <b>0:</b> Abort indexing<br />
    <b>1:</b> Clear the affected track and continue<br />
    <b>2:</b> Stop indexing the track but keep all the index entries so far<br />
    <b>3:</b> Continue anyway<br />
</p>

<p>
<b>adjustdelay:</b>
  Try to apply a suitable delay to the audio track. -1 is the default mode and should produce correct results in most cases<br />
    <b>-3:</b> No delay adjustment<br />
    <b>-2:</b> Adjust relative to time 0<br />
    <b>-1:</b> Adjust relative to the first video track, adjusts the delay relative to time 0 if no video track is present<br />
    <b>Any valid track number:</b> Adjust relative to the specified track<br />
</p>

<p>
<b>utf8:</b>
  If set to true, FFMS will assume that the .avs script is encoded as UTF-8 and therefore interpret all filenames as UTF-8 encoded strings. This makes it possible to open files with funny filenames that otherwise would not be openable.<br />
  <b>NOTE:</b> You must make sure you save the file without a BOM (byte-order marker) or Avisynth will refuse to open it. Notepad will write a BOM, so use something else.<br />
  You should also note that setting this parameter incorrectly will cause all file openings to fail unless your filenames are exclusively 7-bit ASCII compatible.
</p>

<h2>Exported Avisynth variables</h2>
<p>
<b>FFSAR_NUM, FFSAR_DEN, FFSAR:</b>
 The playback aspect ratio specified by the container. FFSAR_NUM and FFSAR_DEN make up the rational number of the ratio and FFSAR is only provided for convenience and may not be set in case it cannot be calculated (FFSAR_DEN=0).
</p>

<p>
<b>FFCROP_LEFT, FFCROP_RIGHT, FFCROP_TOP, FFCROP_BOTTOM:</b>
 The on playback cropping specified by the container.
</p>

<p>
<b>FFCOLOR_SPACE:</b>
 The output colorimetry. Matches the values used by ColorMatrix() as input.
</p>

<p>
<b>FFCOLOR_RANGE:</b>
 The range used by the output.<br />
    <b>0:</b> Unknown/unspecified<br />
    <b>1:</b> Limited-range<br />
    <b>2:</b> Full-range<br />
</p>


<p>
<b>FFPICT_TYPE:</b>
 The picture type of the most recently requested frame as the ascii number of the character listed below. Use Chr() to convert it to an actual letter in avisynth. Use after_frame=true in Avisynth's conditional scripting for proper results. Only set when rffmode=0. The FFmpeg source definition of the characters:
</p>
<pre>
I: Intra
P: Predicted
B: Bi-dir predicted
S: S(GMC)-VOP MPEG4
i: Switching Intra
p: Switching Predicted
b: FF_BI_TYPE (no good explanation available)
?: Unknown
</pre>

<p>
<b>FFVFR_TIME:</b>
 The actual time of the source frame in milliseconds. Only set when no type of CFR conversion is being done (rffmode and fpsnum left at their defaults).
</p>
